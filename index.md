# Clusters of Accra

Scroll through this page to discover different clusters of Accra. Each map includes one or a set of clusters that describe the built environment, the natural environment or a mix of the two. The clusters are created with satellite imagery and an unsupervised computer vision algorithm that groups visually similar areas together.

*Eight different clusters plotted on top of a map of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA)*


How to use the interactive maps:
- Click the +/- buttons or scroll to zoom in and out.
- Click the top left icon to view the legend that describes the different colours on the map.
- Click the top right icon to open the map in a new tab.


Let me know if you can spot certain neighbourhoods within the clusters and if they make sense to you.
I'm especially interested in the following questions:

### Why do you think these clusters emerge?
* Are they influenced by geography (e.g. elevation, soil, etc.)
* Are they influenced by human action (e.g. areas of trade or transport, etc.)
* Are they influenced by historical planning (e.g. colonial city planning, etc.)


### What do they mean for humans living in these areas?
* What are the implications of living in a certain 'cluster'?
* What is the impact of location? (Inner/ outer Accra?)
* Is living in a certain cluster good/ bad for wellbeing and health?
* What changes could they bring in the future?

## Densely populated areas

Cluster specific questions:
- Are there any differences between the two dark grey clusters?
- What are the implications of living in these areas?

## Natural environments

Specific questions regarding the brown 'empty land' cluster:
- What are advantages/disadvantages of living in areas that are close to rubble/sandy ground?
- Will the city most like expand into these areas?
- Are these areas related to mining activities (in the past or present)?
