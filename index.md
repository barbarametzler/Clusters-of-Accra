# Clusters of Accra

Scroll to discover different clusters of Accra. Each map includes one or a set of clusters that describe the built or non-built environment of the city.
The clusters are created with an unsupervised computer vision technique and therefore only requires images as input.

Let me know if you discover some neighbourhoods within the clusters and if they make sense to you.
I'm also interested in the following questions:

### Why do you think these clusters emerge?
* Are they influenced by geography (e.g. elevation, soil, etc.)
* Are they influenced by human action (e.g. areas of trade or transport, etc.)
* Are they influenced by historical planning (e.g. colonial city planning, etc.)


### What do they mean for humans living in these areas?
* What are the implications of living in a certain 'cluster'?
* Inner/ outer Accra? What is the impact of location?
* Is living in a certain area good/ bad for wellbeing?
* What changes could they bring in the future?

## Natural environments

Cluster specific questions (Brown 'empty land' cluster):
- What are advantages/disadvantages of living in areas that are close to rubble/sandy ground?
- Will the city most like expand into these areas?
