# Clusters of Accra

Scroll through this page to discover different clusters of Accra. Each map includes one or a set of clusters that describe the built or non-built environment of the city. The clusters are created with an unsupervised computer vision technique and therefore only requires images as input.

How to use the maps:
- Click the +/- buttons or scroll to zoom in and out.
- Click the top left icon to look at the legend that describes the different colours on the map.
- Click the top right icon to open the map in a new tab.


Let me know if you discover some neighbourhoods within the clusters and if they make sense to you.
I'm also interested in the following questions:

### Why do you think these clusters emerge?
* Are they influenced by geography (e.g. elevation, soil, etc.)
* Are they influenced by human action (e.g. areas of trade or transport, etc.)
* Are they influenced by historical planning (e.g. colonial city planning, etc.)


### What do they mean for humans living in these areas?
* What are the implications of living in a certain 'cluster'?
* Inner/ outer Accra? What is the impact of location?
* Is living in a certain area good/ bad for wellbeing?
* What changes could they bring in the future?

## Natural environments

Cluster specific questions (Brown 'empty land' cluster):
- What are advantages/disadvantages of living in areas that are close to rubble/sandy ground?
- Will the city most like expand into these areas?
