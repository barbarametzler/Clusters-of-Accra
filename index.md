Let me know if you discover some neighbourhoods within the clusters and if they make sense to you.
I'm also interested in the following questions:

### Why do you think these clusters emerge?
* Geography
* Human action
* Historical planning


### What do they mean for humans living in these areas?
* Implications
* Inner/ outer Accra? (Impact of location)
* Good/ bad for wellbeing?
* What changes could they bring in the future?
